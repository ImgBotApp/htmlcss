			<h3>Graphics</h3>
			<p>
Drawing was the first activity I recall being passionate about as it enabled me to block out a world that could get confusing for a clueless kid. When I discovered video games, I likely spent equal time playing as I did drawing cartoons based on them. In providing illustrations for Energraft, I committed to adhering to the codebase-inherited practice of rendering all sprites pixel perfect. I began creating symbols when I was compelled by the realization of shallowness to impart a sense of depth past the initial impression.
			</p>
			<h4>Illustrations</h4>
			<p>
I created sprites for a video game (<a href="/apps.html" target="_blank">in-game screens</a>), which are interspersed throughout the following directory along with other game art: <a href="https://github.com/rjbx/2dgame-demo/tree/master/core/assets/images" target="_blank">github.com/rjbx/2dgame-demo/tree/master/core/assets/images</a>
			</p>
			<h4>Icons</h4>
			<p>
I attempted to incorporate into an icon all or parts of the typography of an ability (move; climb; wall jump; dash; hover) of a video game character, as well as, in the initial two samples, the form of a body lifting an object, and a ladder, respectively.
			</p>
			<ul class="images">
				<li><image src="/images/icon-move.png" alt="Move Icon"></li>
				<li><image src="/images/icon-climb.png" alt="Climb Icon"></li>
				<li><image src="/images/icon-rappel.png" alt="Rappel Icon"></li>
				<li><image src="/images/icon-dash.png" alt="Dash Icon"></li>
				<li><image src="/images/icon-hover.png" alt="Hover Icon"></li>
			</ul>
			<h4>Logos</h4>
			<p>
I attempted to incorporate all or parts of the typography of "Qualiv" into a logo, as well as, respectively, the form of a bird (top-down-body as well as head-side), an olive, a face, and legs.
			</p>
			<ul class="images">
				<li><image src="/images/logo-qualiv1.png" alt="Qualiv Logo 1" width="235" height="235"></li>
				<li><image src="/images/logo-qualiv2.png" alt="Qualiv Logo 2" width="235" height="235"></li>
				<li><image src="/images/logo-qualiv3.png" alt="Qualiv Logo 3" width="235" height="235"></li>
				<li><image src="/images/logo-qualiv4.png" alt="Qualiv Logo 4" width="235" height="235"></li>
