			<p>
From being inspired to design a software system with no coding experience, to playing around with WordPress, to getting my first program to compile, to being amazed by the convenience switching from procedural to object oriented paradigms, to getting lost in, and in the process coming to realize new, possibilities, through developing a game world, software has provided me with a medium with which I could constantly explore and experience, regardless of my circumstances or whereabouts, and without which I might never have worked up the confidence to try other creative endeavors.  It has truly been a game changer in my life.
