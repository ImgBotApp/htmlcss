			<h3>Sounds</h3>
			<p>
I have long favored listening to but never much tried my hand at composing music. While coming to grips with my medical situation, I drove three hours to buy a used guitar for $50. I loved it but was too distracted, playing in short spurts before forgetting that it existed for several months. Wanting to retain progress, I committed to practicing and experimenting more regularly and, gaining a better sense of the key to a composition I enjoyed, branched out into creating sound effects and chip tunes.
