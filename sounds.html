			<h3>Sounds</h3>
			<p>
I never much tried composing music until recently, after driving three hours to buy a used guitar for $50. Initially I was too distracted, playing in short spurts before forgetting that it existed for several months. I committed to retaining progress by practicing and experimenting more regularly, and later branched out into creating sound effects and chip tunes.
