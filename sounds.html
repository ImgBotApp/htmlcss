			<h3>Sounds</h3>
			<p>
I always listened to but was never able, nor much tried, to compose music, despite having a guitar that sat around and collected dust for most of my adolescence. At a time I was coming to grips with my medical situation, I drove across state lines to buy a used short scale guitar for $50 (one my smallish hands could better navigate). While I loved it, I was too distracted, playing in short spurts before forgetting that it existed for several months. After realizing how in this cycle I was never able to retain progress, I committed to practicing more regularly. The monotony of playing the same arrangements pushed me to experiment, and while the initial result was never satisfactory, I would refine with different combinations of notes and rhythms until hitting a sweet spot. As I became more familiar with these new arrangements, I found myself humming tunes in my head that required increasingly less and sometimes no refining. Gaining a better sense of the key to a composition I enjoyed, I branched out into creating sound effects and chip tunes.
