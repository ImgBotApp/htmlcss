			<h3>About</h3>
			<p>
I am an amateur in creative forms save for software development in which I am a novice. I began documenting my journey at a time when I had, rather than explain and expect understanding of a degenerative condition, stopped communicating with people in my life who wondered what I did all day. I viewed publication as a tool for tracking progress as well as confronting fear of judgement. Having once staked pride in my work ethic, I have been challenged most by pacing; knowing when and how much I can do.  Over time, my condition has ameliorated to the extent that, with caution and flexibility, I am able to remotely study, practice, volunteer and work part-time while living without personal assistance. My goal is to improve my work quality to be serviceable in freelance opportunities; details are below.
			</p>
			<h4>Support</h4>
			<p>
In the process of creating the content posted to this site, I have been fortunate to have support in: legal matters, limited to advice from primarily pro-bono counselors (on writing a software specification and structuring a nonprofit); organizational matters, limited to moral encouragement from friends (on incorporating a nonprofit and an early attempt to make a website); and technical matters, limited to instruction received from professors on their course materials (on programming) at the time of my enrollment.
			</p>
			<p>
On technical works, I have utilized free and/or open-source materials comprising primarily web-based reference and advisory texts, libraries, code bases and development tools.  On artistic works, I haven't yet sought instruction due to my current focus on improving my programming skills.
			</p>
			<h4>Freelance</h4>
