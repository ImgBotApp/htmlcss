			<h3>About</h3>
			<p>
				I am a novice software developer, and amateur graphic designer and sound composer, who found inspiration in a diagnosed physiological condition. I began documenting my journey at a time when I had, rather than explain and expect understanding of my situation, stopped communicating with the people in my life including immediate family who wondered what I did all day. I viewed publication as not only a tool for tracking my progress and thought process but also for overcoming fear of judgement which is necessary for feedback and improvement. 

				My condition does not prevent me from, and I am, managing all of my own care and responsibilities without assistance, though at times do require careful planning and pacing. My leisure time is spent volunteering, listening to and playing music, reading on computing and IT, and communicating in a foreign, loosely-defined language with my pet rabbit.  If my work could ever be of service, I am available for freelance opportunities; details are below.
