This project represents a first attempt to build a website from scratch.  Design is not intended to be aesthetic but is based off of features as I seek out and learn about them.  

I built several sites in the past using tools like WordPress that allowed me to focus most of my time on content and design. Desiring a lower-level understanding of web development, I thought it would be best to dive in on my own with nothing more than a text editor. Gaining such an understanding I hoped would allow me to build sites that are more efficient, flexible and powerful.  

No Javascript has yet been used in the making of this site to maximize performance efficiency. 

While the content is real, the subject matter is arbitrary (I needed something to put on the page) and this is not intended to be a portfolio site.
